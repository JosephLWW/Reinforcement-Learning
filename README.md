# Reinforcement-Learning
We create machine learning algorithms that can adapt and learn from dynamic simulated or real enviroments, just like living beings do!
This repository has been created in the context of the lecture Reinforcement Learning lecture WS2024/2025 from the University of TÃ¼bingen.
